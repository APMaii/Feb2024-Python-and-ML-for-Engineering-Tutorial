## üìù **Lecture Files** 
The core of the course is provided through a series of Python scripts labeled from `Session02_Course24.py` to `Session16_FINAL_Course24.py`. Each session introduces new concepts, code examples, and exercises to build your proficiency in Python and machine learning.

### **Session Breakdown**:
- **Session02_Course24.py**: Introduction to Python programming, covering basic concepts like variables, data types, loops, conditionals (`if`, `for`, etc.), and functions.
- **Session03_Course24.py**: Introduction to Python's standard libraries and functions, such as `math`, `random`, and string manipulation.
- **Session04_Course24.py**: Deeper dive into Python classes, object-oriented programming (OOP), and practical examples.
- **Session05_Course24.py**: Working with external libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, and `pandas` for numerical analysis and data manipulation.
- **Session06 to Session16_FINAL_Course24.py**: Progressively more complex topics, including:
    - Data visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
    - Machine learning fundamentals (`sklearn`)
    - Practical engineering applications in ML
    - Final project and advanced case studies
